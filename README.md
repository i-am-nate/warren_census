# warren_census

### About
A comparison of Warren public US Census survey data compared to Macomb County and to Michigan across 10 years (2011 and 2021). Softwares utilized: Google Sheets, SQL/BigQuery, Tableau.

### Overview
Attached here are a few .csv files, 5 .pdf files, 1 .png, and the full .zip containing the visuals associated with this combined dataset. To view everything in one spot, [here is the link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wOJMW_ut2TIKjMk5yDdE2o7tYk8X7kE1BSzvrFA80k0/edit?usp=sharing) to the Google Sheets where it is all laid out there.

### Contextual understanding
'raw.csv' is the resulting imported .csv file from the initial SQL 'join' of the 6 databases.
That query was performed within public datasets using BigQuery, and a screenshot of that query is attached (sql.png).

### Data understanding
'cleaned.csv' represents the data cleaned version of the data (also translated into long instead of wide data).

The remaining 5 .pdf files are exported from the Google Sheet and represent subsets of various data points from the full 'cleaned.csv': comparing races, education, population, commutes, and vehicles.

Visualizations and key takeaways are included within each .pdf and are the same as what lies within the Google Sheet.
You may also find all the data visualizations within the 'data_viz.zip'.
